📌 Project Overview:
The Pigeon is a mobile application designed to replicate the most loved features of a traditional newspaper within a clean, modern digital interface. The goal is to create an all-in-one app that keeps users informed, entertained, and connected—just like a physical newspaper—but with the convenience of a smartphone.

🧠 Research & Insights:
🔍 User Survey
Users were asked: “What feature of a newspaper would you like to replicate into the app?”

Top responses:

Job Boards (25%)

Crosswords (23.4%)

Organized Content (13.4%)

Credibility (12%)

Technology News (11.2%)

Extras, Comics (15% combined)

This indicated strong demand for features that support both utility (job listings, credibility) and engagement (crosswords, comics).

🧠 Brainstorming
Ideas generated include:

Job boards

Daily comics

Widgets

Live updates

Weekly summaries

Promotions & discounts

Instant news and credibility

These shaped the initial feature ideation to cover both information dissemination and user engagement.

⚔️ Competitive Analysis
The Pigeon stands out because:

It offers all key features—Free access, Live News, Crosswords, Job Boards, and Hashtags.

Competitors like The Hindu, TOI, BBC, etc., lack this combination.

This gap validated the opportunity for a well-rounded, newspaper-replacement app.
